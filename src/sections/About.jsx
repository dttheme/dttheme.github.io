      <p>
        I've had many jobs over the years, in customer service, merchandising,
        event planning and more. I consider myself a Jane of All Trades and can
        wear many hats at once. For the last 8 years, I've worked as a software
        engineer. I've worked at startups, corporations, mid-size companies, and
        have started my own business. I've designed and built production
        websites from scratch.
      </p>
      <p>
        When my dad passed in July '23, I took a sabbatical from engineering. I
        have been working as an artist, fulfilling a life-long dream. I have
        spent the last year vending at markets around Atlanta, building my own
        brand, and connecting with my community.
      </p>
