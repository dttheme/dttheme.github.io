      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hey! I'm Dyanna, an artist and software engineer based in Atlanta.</p>
      <p>
        I've been working professionally as a fullstack software engineer since
        2018. Most recently, I was Senior Software Engineer at Intuit Mailchimp.
        I've worked in React, Vue, Node, and Python, specializing in auditing
        and accessibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        After my father passed in July of 2023, I decided to take some time away
        from engineering to start my art business.

        has since showcased at 6 markets around Atlanta to great support from
        the community. PBP continues to grow and exeed my expectations, and I
        look forward to what the future brings!
