      <h2>What is it?</h2>
      <p>
        A course to help you build a website that you code yourself and host for
        free on Github.{" "}
      </p>
      <h2>What's the Point?</h2>
      <p>
        To offer an accessible lesson plan and mentorship to others in a cohort
        style. I value a decentralized web, and teaching non-engineers how to
        hold space on the internet is important. There are ways to learn how to
        do this on your own, but if you're like me, you need some accountability
        and someone to ask questions of.
      </p>
      <h2>What Will I Learn?</h2>
      <p>
        We'll utilize a few free software, websites, and coding languages to
        progress from nothing to a fully hosted, coded personal site for the
        price of a domain (~$10 a year)
      </p>
      <p>
        We'll purchase a domain, learn how to use the command line, and employ
        GitHub to preserve and host our sites.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>VSCode</li>
        <li>GitHub</li>
        <li>Git</li>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We'll also cover the mindset and skills required to persevere through
        learning in this course.
