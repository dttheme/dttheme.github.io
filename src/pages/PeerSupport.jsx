      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a Certified Peer Specialist (CPS) in the state of Georgia and a
        queer, neurodivergent adult with lived experience of trauma and
        recovery. I offer 1:1 peer support sessions and open office hours rooted
        in mutual respect, lived truth, and community care.
      </p>
      <p>
        Peer support is not therapy; it’s a relationship between equals. I don’t
        diagnose or do the work for you. Instead, I show up as myself: someone
        who’s walked a winding mental health recovery path and is still walking
        that path. I’m here to witness, reflect, and support you as you navigate
        your own way. I can offer perspective, as well as referral to verified
        resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        This work is offered on a NOTAFLOF basis — no one turned away for lack
        of funds. Sessions are available at no cost, with sliding-scale
        donations appreciated if you’re able to contribute.

      <ul>

        <li>Learning new ways of being and healing</li>

      </p>
      <h3>Weekly Office Hours</h3>

        schedule a 1:1 session. Office hours are casual and freeform, and you’re
        welcome whether you’re curious about peer support, want to share space,
        or just need a familiar presence.

      <h2>My Why</h2>
      <p>
        I have been in recovery from complex PTSD for over 10 years. Since
        receiving my first diagnosis at age 25, I’ve engaged with a wide range
        of healing practices, which I listed at the top of this page. In 2021, I
        was also diagnosed with autism, and received support around
        understanding and integrating that experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        I feel called to use all the valuable information I've acquired over the
        years to help others that are going through the same diagnoses,
        struggling in the same ways, and could use someone to listen or give
        advice.
