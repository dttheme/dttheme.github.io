      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>
        I‚Äôm a Certified Peer Specialist (CPS) in the state of Georgia, an
        artist, and a queer, neurodivergent adult with lived experience of
        trauma and healing. I offer 1:1 peer support sessions and open office
        hours rooted in mutual respect, lived truth, and community care.
      </p>
      <p>
        Peer support is not therapy ‚Äî it‚Äôs a relationship between equals. I
        don‚Äôt diagnose, fix, or advise from a distance. Instead, I show up as
        myself: someone who‚Äôs walked a winding path and is still walking. I‚Äôm
        here to witness, listen, reflect, and support you as you navigate your
        own way.
      </p>
      <p>
        This work is offered on a NOTAFLOF basis ‚Äî no one turned away for lack
        of funds. Sessions are available at no cost, with sliding-scale
        donations appreciated if you‚Äôre able to contribute.

      <h2>What I Offer</h2>
      <h3>1:1 Peer Support Sessions</h3>
      <ul>
        A gentle, nonjudgmental space for:
        <li>Talking through hard or tender things</li>
        <li>Emotional grounding or sensory overwhelm</li>
        <li>Navigating trauma recovery, identity, and growth</li>
        <li>Reflecting on patterns, choices, or healing journeys</li>
      </ul>
      Sessions are held via Zoom or phone and typically last 45‚Äì60 minutes.
      <h3>Weekly Office Hours</h3>
      <p>
        Open time to ask questions, chat, or just hang out ‚Äî no pressure to
        schedule a session. Office hours are casual and freeform, and you‚Äôre
        welcome whether you‚Äôre curious about peer support, want to share space,
        or just need a familiar presence.
      </p>

      <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
      <ul>
        I‚Äôm especially eager to connect with:
        <li>Other queer and/or neurodivergent folks </li>
        <li>People navigating trauma, burnout, or recovery </li>
        <li>Adults who are masking, unmasking, or somewhere in between</li>
        <li>Those seeking community outside of clinical models</li>
        <li> If any of this resonates, I‚Äôd love to meet you.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>

        session or ask about office hours. I‚Äôll respond with availability and a

        to ‚Äúqualify‚Äù for support ‚Äî if you want it, you deserve it. üí∏ NotAFLOF:
