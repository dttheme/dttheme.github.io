      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a Certified Peer Specialist (CPS) in the state of Georgia and a
        queer, neurodivergent adult with lived experience of trauma and
        recovery. I offer 1:1 peer support sessions and open office hours rooted
        in mutual respect, lived truth, and community care.
      </p>
      <p>
        Peer support is not therapy; it’s a relationship between equals. I don’t
        diagnose or do the work for you. Instead, I show up as myself: someone
        who’s walked a winding mental health recovery path and is still walking
        that path. I’m here to witness, reflect, and support you as you navigate
        your own way.
      </p>
      <p>
        This work is offered on a NOTAFLOF basis — no one turned away for lack
        of funds. Sessions are available at no cost, with sliding-scale
        donations appreciated if you’re able to contribute.

      <h2>What I Offer</h2>
      <h3>1:1 Peer Support Sessions</h3>
      <p>A gentle, nonjudgmental space for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Talking through hard or tender things</li>
        <li>Reflecting on patterns, choices, or healing journeys</li>
        <li>Supporting trauma recovery, identity, and growth</li>
        <li>Learning new ways of being and healing</li>
        <li>Getting connected with effective resources</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Sessions are typically held via Google Meet or phone and typically last
        45–60 minutes.
      </p>
      <h3>Weekly Office Hours</h3>
      <p>
        Open time to ask questions, chat, or just hang out — no pressure to
        schedule a 1:1 session. Office hours are casual and freeform, and you’re
        welcome whether you’re curious about peer support, want to share space,
        or just need a familiar presence.
      </p>

      <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
      <p>I’m especially eager to connect with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Other queer and/or neurodivergent folks </li>
        <li>People navigating trauma, burnout, or recovery </li>
        <li>Adults who are masking, unmasking, or somewhere in between</li>
        <li>Those seeking community outside of clinical models</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If any of this resonates, I’d love to meet you.</p>

      <h2>My Why</h2>
      <p>
        I have been in recovery for CPTSD for 10 years. Since I received my
        initial diagnosis at age 25, I have been through CBT, DBT, EMDR,
        neurofeedback, brain-spotting, psychiatric, somatic and art therapy in
        order to get relief. In '21, I was also diagnosed with ASD, and received
        professional help for coping with that diagnosis.
      </p>
      <p>
        I feel called to use all the valuable information I've acquired over the
        years to help others that are going through the same diagnoses,
        struggling in the same ways, and could use someone to listen or give
        advice.
